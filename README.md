LiftWhat is an attempt at making the most simple routine app ever.

I sometimes hop on a routine when I need to free up some brain cycles and there was nothing out there that was just *simple*.

Everything I found required a login, tracked things I didn't care about, etc.

Sometimes you just want to see what week four of Coan Phillipi looks like or maybe reference Prilipin's chart.

That's what LiftWhat is about.

I have been swamped lately, so I opened up the code for all you out there to help.

I apologize in advance...it is sort of a mess. First things first--I am refactoring all the spaghetti JS to templates.

This will make addin and maintaining routines WAY easier and allow for other contributors, like yourself.

Fork, branch, and issue a pull request. I'd like to hammer out all the current issues. They are all based on user feedback.

Any questions, feel free to email me.


Kick ass.
